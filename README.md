   #### Note:


- Roleen V1 is a  Telegram bot project is designed to automate tasks, respond to commands, and integrate with external services or APIs, offering users a robust interactive experience.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for easy user interaction.

## Deployment and Setup

### Necessities

- Telegram account
- Telegram Bot Token
- Telegram Bot User ID(uid)
- **[`HERE IS`](https://github.com/mouricedevs/telegram-bot/blob/main/gift/bot-token-and-uid.md) How to get your BOT TOKEN and BOT UID**

### Configure the Bot:
   - Ensure you forked the repo first so that you be able to edit it on your forked repo.
   - There's a set.js.
   - Navigate to it and Add your bot token, bot user ID(id) and other settings:
     ```
     "ownerId": bot owner user id
     ```
     ```
     "botToken": "bot token "
     ```

### Deployment

- **It can still be Deployed in heroku but I am trying to put a free place that is easy to get it up and runing **

- **Deploy on [RENDER](https://dashboard.render.com/new)**
  
  - Follow other specific platform instructions to deploy your bot because as for me I do use Heroku.

## Usage

To interact with the bot, users can send commands and messages. The bot will respond based on its features and functionality. Here are some examples:

- `/menu / /start` - Displays a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `And Many Other Cmds` - Use the bot to discover by yourself.





- I'll always be adding more commands, features and making general updates so always check‚úÖ out and sync your forks to stay updated.
